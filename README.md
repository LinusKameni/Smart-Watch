# Smart-Watch
This repository represents the source code for a LILYGO T-WATCH. Three main functionalities have been integrated: 
A running mode, which can be activated while jogging and measures the covered distance, as well as calculates the calorie consumption. 
A timer mode that starts a vibration alarm when the timer expires.  
A memory mode, which is a memory game based on "Simon Says".
